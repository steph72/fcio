# JITSA

This project was proudly brought to you using the JITSA development model.

You may employ JITSA for your own projects free of charge. Once you have completed a project using the JITSA model, you may even call yourself "certified JITSA master" without spending a thousand $$$ on useless certificate hocus pocus. All I am asking is that you kindly include this file along with any released JITSA-enabled project, so that other people may learn of the power of JITSA, too.

## "That's great, but just what is JITSA?"

JITSA is a software development model, just like Scrum. 

JITSA is the abbreviation for "**J**ust **I**mplement **T**hat **S**hit **A**lready". It was conceived during hours and hours of meaningless meetings, retros, refinements, blame games, plannings, plannings-phase-two, post-market-surveillances, jour-fixes, and other assorted what-have-yous, burning tons of company money and getting nowhere slowly.

It is rooted in the realization that in modern software development methodologies, people often rather spend their time applying and discussing all kinds of rules and rituals than acutally getting any work done. Or, even worse: People who never ever wrote one single line of useful code debate on hours without end about how an application should be written and then force some poor code slaves to do some meaningless and unfulfilling work.

Scrum & friends may once have come with the best of intentions, but unfortunately they encourage such behaviour, especially when applied the wrong way (which is the common way agile methodologies are applied nowadays).

If you - like me - have learned your craft back in the golden days of writing programs on the C64 and later hacking your way into the newly invented WWW, this mode of "work" can be terribly frustrating, to say the least. I've been a software developer for over 30 years now, and I have witnessed my trade getting mutilated and devalued by all kinds of religiously applied methodology bullshit. So I tried to come up with an alternative to the so-called 12 principles of agile programming... by writing my own 12 principles which aim to address things gone horribly wrong in today's "agile" development techniques.

Here they are (for easier reference, they are presented next to their corresponding "principle of agile programming"):

    <tr>
        <td>2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. </td>
        <td>2. Requirement changes late in development are a telltale sign of business people involvement. Don't involve business people.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. </td>
        <td>3. Just implement that shit already in the pace that's right for you and don't let timescales stress you.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</td>
        <td>4. Business people suck. Nobody needs them. So, don't involve businesss people.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</td>

        <td>12. At regular intervals, inhale some air into your lungs and then exhale in order to ensure the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide... wait, what? Why do I have to tell you this? I mean, this should come natural to anybody. Just *do* something, and if you screw up, *learn* from it. Jeez, since when do we need rules for the most basic aspects of being human?</td>

## But What Does It Mean?

Glad you asked. So here's the deal: You write software because you want to write software. You want to do something awesome. You don't do it for a "customer" or for "business people" or for your "product owner" or your barber or your lawyer or your congressmen or to satisfy rules, you write it because of you, and because you want to give it your best. 
What's that? You don't want to write software? Then don't. Do something else. It's a big old world out there with lots of opportunities.
You want or need to write software in a team? Right on, go ahead. Find the right people who get along with each other and do it. You don't get along with each other? Try harder. Still not getting along? Find other people. Or do it alone. It's as simple as that.

## Where To Go From Here

Of course JITSA is not really meant as an alternative to Scrum or Kanban or whatever it is they make you do these days. It most probably won't work in every situation.

It's more of a guideline on how to take programming back into your own hands, and doing something awesome for yourself, like it was in the good old days... a feeling most of my younger colleagues - sadly - have never known.
